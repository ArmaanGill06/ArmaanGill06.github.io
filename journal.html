So far, I have made many creations in CS1! In the class, we started off with just a basic intro to HTML. We then went on to do styling with CSS, and we worked through a “person card” in Sublime text. I eventually did two things that I really like. Squash and watching tv. I put two squash rackets layed down crossing a squash ball, and when you hovered the mouse over the image, it spun around and turned into Stewie from Family Guy. I thought this covered my two interests. Since then, we have gone into JavaScript. We made our own “lets”, and then called different types of functions that we designed. We still have not really done much with it, but I am sure we will. Lastly, we just made our own websites and person cards to store them. These will be the links for our websites! 

One frustrating aspect of the class is that whenever you make a mistake, nothing works. It could be one small typo, but that typo causes everything to stop, and a lot of the time, the system does not say what your error was. So then you have to comb through 100 lines of code for a small typo. Another frustrating part of the class is that if you fall behind on something, or your code isn't working, it is hard for Ms. Josephs to find an error since we are all online. It takes a good five minutes to find a problem most of the time, and we only have one class a week. That leads me to my last point, we only have one class a week. It is very hard to learn Comp Sci if we have a humongous class shoved down your throat for one time a week. We really should have two fifty minute classes.

One thing that I did not expect but am actually very happy about is how far we have already progressed in such little time. I took an intro to coding class in seventh grade, and we were at this point in maybe two months (I do not remember a single thing from that class by the way). It is very nice to see the fruits of your labor when it actually all comes together and works like you want it to. Also, when I was making my person card, I accidentally did something that I actually really ended up liking. Thats the fun part of the class. Even mistakes lead to something super cool. I am super proud of what I have done so far!

Lastly, moving forward, I would love to design things like pong. Super simple games that we could all play together, and it would be super fun to do!

Well, we have gone from tiny code sketches to whole websites. I am super impressed with the progree me and my peers are making in such a short amount of time. I never would have thought I would be half way done making my own website in three weeks. I have had a bunch of help from Ms. Josephs, who has given me awesome ideas for my website. The reason I put up the gif of the Golem sitting on the hog is because the company that made this, Supercell, was such a big part of my life till pretty recently, and I felt that I had to represent. Essentially, I have been playing their videogames for ten years, and they made a mini tv series which I love. Moving on, I matched the colors of the menu bar to the golem's skin tone and the mountains in the background (which was Ms. Josephs' idea). I also linked this journal page and the page where you can play virtual squash to this. I still have to make an "about me" site, but that should not be too hard.
